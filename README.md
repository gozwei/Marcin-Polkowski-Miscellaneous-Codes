# Marcin Polkowski: Miscellaneous Codes

In this repo I keep different small code samples of my own. Some were done just for fun, others for different reasons described below. 

## 2016_Float_Fun

This example was primarily created for fun, however I use it to show my students magic of floating point numbers. 

## 2016_TESLA

In summer 2016 I've found interesting job offer from Tesla Motors and I decided to apply. One of the recreation steps involved solving Coding Challenge. I give you full Coding Challenge and my solution. 

## 2017_Move_One_Match

This example was created just for fun, however I'm thinking about using it as an example for my Introduction to Python course. 

## 2017_Python_C++

This example was created as an answer to popular question within my colleagues: how to make my Python faster?
